			<h3>1946–1974: Beginnings</h3>
			<p>On 11 June 1946, following the aftermath of World War II, Poland played their first international friendly match, against Norway in Oslo, 
				a 3–1 defeat. The biggest success in the early years after the war was the victory against one of Europe's best at the time, Czechoslovakia. 
				Poland defeated their southern neighbors 3–1. Poland suffered the worst defeat in the team's history on 26 April 1948 with a 0–8 loss to 
				the Danish side. Poland would later erase that memory as they posted their second highest ever victory in Szczecin when they took down Norway 9–0 
				on 4 September 1963. The game marked the debut for Włodzimierz Lubański. He scored one of the goals in the game. Lubański became the all-time 
				top scorer for Poland while playing from 1963 to 1980 scoring 48 goals in 75 appearances. This victory was surpassed on 1 April 2009 in Kielce 
				when Poland defeated San Marino 10–0.

			<h3>1974–1986: "Golden Era"</h3>
			<p>Poland being mostly unknown on the international football scene before 1974 shook up the football world during the World Cup in Germany. 
				However, this was no huge surprise as the core of the team successfully achieved a gold medal place in the Munich Olympics in 1972. 
				The Olympics were not considered a major tournament by most Western nations, but Eastern European countries bypassed the amateur rules by fielding 
				their full national teams, as most players also had employment with national industries or within the army. With their lightning speed 
				and incredible team chemistry they were almost unstoppable. In qualifying they surprised everyone by eliminating England, quarter-finalists in 1970 
				and Champions in 1966.

			<h3>1986–2001: Decline</h3>
			<p>After the "Golden Era" from the 1970s and 1980s, Poland suffered a severe drought in international football; they didn't qualify for three 
				consecutive editions of the FIFA World Cup, failing to qualify in 1990, 1994 and 1998. In 1990 World Cup qualifying, Poland finished 3rd 
				in the qualifying group, behind Sweden and England, on 5 points with two wins, one draw and three defeats. They began qualifying for 
				the 1990 edition with a 1–0 win over Albania, before defeats to Sweden (2–1) and England (3–0). Poland then drew 0–0 with England, lost to 
				Sweden 0–2 and beat Albania 2–1 in their final game, but were 4 points behind England; thus failing to qualify.
